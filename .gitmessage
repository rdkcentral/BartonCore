# Barton Commit Message Format
# =============================
#
# The following is a summary of the Barton commit message format, but
# the full specification can be found at:
# https://github.com/rdkcentral/BartonCore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format
#
# A Barton commit messages must be structured as follows:
#
# <header>
# <BLANK LINE>
# <body>
# <BLANK LINE>
# <footer>
#
# Where the header is mandatory and the body and footer are optional.
#
# Commit Message Header
# ---------------------
#
# Header format:
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# The header is composed of three sections:
# 1. `type` - required
# 2. `scope` - optional
# 3. `subject` - required
#
# The following are the types that should be used:
# - `build:` Modifications impacting the build system or external
#            dependencies
# - `ci:` Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
# - `docs:` Documentation only changes
# - `feat:` A new feature
# - `fix:` A bug fix
# - `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a
#               feature
# - `revert:` A commit that reverts a previous commit
# - `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#            (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
# - `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#
# Scopes can include device drivers, subsystems, documentation or
# nothing at all.
#
# The subject is a distinct, succinct description of the change
#
# Commit Message Body
# -------------------
#
# Explain in detail what was done in this commit and what this is
# supposed to achieve. Wrap all lines at 72 characters.
#
# Commit Message Footer
# ---------------------
#
# The footer is optional and may include details about breaking changes
# and deprecations. It is also the appropriate section to reference
# GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or
# relates to.
