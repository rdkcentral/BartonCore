# Barton Device Service Overview
In Barton, Device Service is responsible for the management and interactions
with all devices.  Devices can connect with various protocols and technologies
including Zigbee, Matter, and OpenHome. Note that much of the discussion in this
documentation is about Zigbee devices, but many of the concepts applies to
devices on other technologies.  Devices belong to a Device Class which defines
the type of device.  Some examples of Device Classes are Camera, Light, Door Lock,
and Sensor (and many others).  Each Device Class supports one or more
endpoints, each of which supports an Endpoint Profile.  An endpoint on a device
can be thought of as a port number in networking.  An endpoint provides a
logical set of functionality such as a light switch.  For example, a single
physical device such as a refrigerator could have endpoints for temperature,
lights, door sensors, etc.

Devices are exposed to clients as a set of resources that can be read, written,
and executed depending on their type and purpose.  More details on how devices
are composed and how to interact with their resources are below.

# Hardware Dependencies
Device Service can function without any hardware dependencies, however its
capabilities might be reduced.  Below are the common potential hardware
dependencies depending on configuration.
## Zigbee
If Device Service is built with Zigbee support there should be an implementation of
ZHAL, which is the Zigbee Hardware Abstraction Layer.  This HAL is an atypical HAL
due to the high level application capabilities it is required to provide.  The intent
of ZHAL is to enable portability to different Zigbee stack and silicon vendors.  These
stacks typically provide high level features such as OTA software updating, however if
a stack does not provide these features, the ZHAL implementor must. See
[ZIGBEE_SUPPORT.md](ZIGBEE_SUPPORT.md) for more information.
## Thread
If Device Service is built with Thread support it will backup and restore configuration
for a local OpenThread Border Router instance.  Additionally it will retrieve and use
the associated Thread network credentials when commissioning Matter over Thread devices.
Additional capabilities such as detailed Thread network health monitoring, Thread 1.4
ephemeral code commissioning and others are anticipated enhanceents.  Device Service
expects an OpenThread API over dbus. See [THREAD_SUPPORT.md](THREAD_SUPPORT.md) for
more information.
## Bluetooth/BLE
If Device Service is built with BLE support, Matter devices may be commissioned directly
by Device Service for Thread or Wi-Fi Operational Network access.  Device Service, the
Matter stack actually, expects a Bluez API over dbus.
## Matter
Matter has no hardware requirements for basic functionality since it is an IPv6 based
specification.  It can make use of Thread and BLE for commissioning of new devices,
but after a device has been commissioned for the first time (by any admin/Fabric),
subsequent commissioning is performed only over IPv6. See
[MATTER_SUPPORT.md](MATTER_SUPPORT.md) for more information.


# Key Concepts
## Device Descriptor List (aka Whitelist / Allowlist)
Zigbee devices that are allowed to be commissioned can be controlled through
an 'allow list' which consists of Device Descriptors for each allowed device.
This list is published to a content server and provided to Barton when it
changes.

When a Zigbee device joins the network as part of the pairing process Barton
reads its manufacturer name, model, hardware version, and firmware version.
These 4 attributes are used to locate the appropriate Device Descriptor.  If no
Descriptor is found, the device is rejected and told to leave the network.  An
example of a Device Descriptor is:

~~~xml
<DeviceDescriptor>
   <uuid>f7d49c2b-7324-4857-96eb-cdee9a44d996</uuid>
   <description>ZigBee_Gen2_PIR_Std</description>
   <category>zigbee</category>
   <manufacturer>Bosch</manufacturer>
   <model>RFPR-ZB-MS</model>
   <hardwareVersions>19</hardwareVersions>
   <firmwareVersions>0x21115401,0x22115401,0x23115401,0x23125401,0x23125402</firmwareVersions>
   <latestFirmware>
      <version>0x23125402</version>
      <filename>Bosch_Motion_G2_V23125402.ota</filename>
      <type>ota</type>
   </latestFirmware>
</DeviceDescriptor>
~~~

As shown, the Device Descriptor also contains information about the latest
firmware for the device.  This is downloaded and supplied to the device if it
needs a firmware upgrade.

## Resource Model
As previously described, devices use a URI based resource model to expose
functionality.  One architectural goal of the resource model is to hide the
underlying technology that the device uses (Zigbee, Matter, etc.).  This allows
clients of devices to function without change against devices of any class and
to get automatic support for new devices once new subsystems and device drivers
are added.

Here are example resources and their values for a door/window sensor:

~~~
000d6f000f486af8: Bedroom 1 Window 2, Class: sensor
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/battVolts = 2700
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/communicationFailure = true
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/dateAdded = 1575386127578
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/dateLastContacted = 1579810368616
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/feLqi = 255
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/feRssi = -84
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/firmwareUpdateStatus = (null)
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/firmwareVersion = 0x20190422
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/hardwareVersion = 1
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/lowBatt = false
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/manufacturer = Universal Electronics Inc
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/model = URC4460BC0-X-R
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/neLqi = 243
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/neRssi = -54
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/resetToFactoryDefaults = (null)
    /000d6f000f486af8/r/temp = 1900
    Endpoint 1: Profile: sensor
        /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/bypassed = false
        /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/faulted = false
        /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/label = Bedroom 1 Window 2
        /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/qualified = true
        /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/tampered = false
        /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/type = contactSwitch
~~~

Some resources are read-only such as /000d6f000f486af8/r/battVolts.  Some
resources are executable such as /000d6f000f486af8/r/resetToFactoryDefaults.
Resources like /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/label are read-writable.

Most resources will emit events when they change (broadcast locally from Device
Service to other interested services).  In this example when the door/window
sensor is opened /000d6f000f486af8/ep/1/r/faulted will change to 'true' and
SecurityService will get notified to take appropriate action.

Note that the relationship between resources and Zigbee attributes is not
always 1:1.

## Device Drivers
Device Drivers are bits of code responsible for the mapping of resources to
functionality on a device.  The current set of drivers available in Barton are:

* MatterDoorLock
* MatterLight
* MatterWindowCovering
* philipsHue
* zigbeeDoorLock
* zigbeeLight
* zigbeeLightController
* zigbeePresence
* zigbeeSensor
* zigbeeThermostat
* zigbeeWindowCovering

Drivers are responsible for the configuration of a device (performed during
pairing), creation of its resources, and reacting to changes from the device
and to its resources.

## Subsystems
Subsystems in Device Service provide access to lower level parts of the stack
in a manner safe for concurrent use by device drivers.  Currently Barton has a
subsystem for Zigbee, Matter, and Thread.  Future subsystems for BLE and others are
possible.

## Database
Device Service stores all of its configuration in individual files. An example
directory listing is:

~~~
000d6f000f2081e7  000d6f000f4839e3  000d6f000f4877bc  000d6f0010abe463  systemProperties
000d6f000f4525fb  000d6f000f486af8  000d6f000f6ca643  6cc1d2000052829b
~~~

Note that there will also be backup versions of these files ending in .bak
which were omitted here.

Each file, other than systemProperties represents a single device.  For Zigbee
devices the filenames are EUI64s for the corresponding device.  Below is an
example of a Zigbee sensor's database file contents.

## Device Communication Watchdog
Device Service has a component that is responsible for detecting communication
failure with the devices it manages.  Once the Device Communication Watchdog
determines that a device is in communication failure, the device's
communicationFailure resource (/000d6f000f486af8/r/communicationFailure from
the example device earlier) is set to "true".  This triggers a resource changed
event that can be handled by project specific business logic.

For Zigbee devices, the watchdog tracks the amount of time since the last
successful message to or from the device.  By default the watchdog will report
communication failure after 1 hour without any successful communication.  This
allows for two missed checkin intervals, which are configured for 27 minutes.

# Zigbee Support
Zigbee stack implementations are external to this repository and follow this
general architecture:

![zigbee-arch](zigbee-arch.png)

## ZigbeeSubsystem
The ZigbeeSubsystem is a layer in between Zigbee device drivers and ZHAL
responsible for safely sharing the Zigbee infrastructure between device
drivers.

## ZHAL
ZHAL is the Zigbee Hardware Abstraction Layer.  It is a C library
(libs/zhal) that converts function calls and events into IPC to the
Zigbee implementation.

# Zigbee Firmware Management
Most Zigbee devices are compliant with the Over the Air Upgrade cluster's
firmware management mechanisms that were introduced with the Home Automation
profile version 1.2.

As mentioned in the Device Descriptor section, when a new firmware image is
available for a device, the Device Descriptor List (aka whitelist/allowlist) is
updated with the new firmware version number and filename.  When this updated
list is published and provided to Barton it is scanned for descriptors
matching paired devices.  If a paired device needs an upgrade its file is
downloaded from the content server.  This upgrade mechanism is
"pulled" from the device through image block requests made to the Zigbee stack.
The process starts when the device sends a "query next image" request which
contains its current firmware version.  The response will indicate if
the Zigbee stack has a newer image for it and the device will start pulling
blocks until it finishes.

This upgrade mechanism can take a while, especially on battery powered devices.
While the device is downloading the firmware image it remains fully functional
until the image is fully downloaded and verified at which point it reboots to
the new image.  Reboots typically take less than a second.

Note that once a firmware image for a device is downloaded an "image notify"
command is sent to the device in an attempt to start the upgrade immediately,
however many of our devices are "sleepy" so they will not receive this message.
Devices are required to check once a day, minimum, to see if the Zigbee stack
has a new firmware image available.
