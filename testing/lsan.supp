# In order for pytest to successfully discover tests with libbrtnDeviceServiceShared.so
# compiled with address santizer, the libasan.so must be pre-loaded before invoking
# `pytest --collect-only`. However, preloading libasan.so enables AddressSanitizer for the
# entire process, not just for the specific library compiled with AddressSanitizer.
# This means that all memory allocations and deallocations in the process, including those
# from third-party libraries and Python itself, are tracked by AddressSanitizer. So even
# if tests are found during test discovery, address santizer will report leaks in third
# party libraries and the test process will be considered a failure.
#
# This file instructs address sanitizer to ignore leaks from certain third party libraries so
# test discovery will complete successfully.

# Unclear what is causing leaks from libcrypto from backtraces. It may be relevant to using openssl 1.1.
# We should revisit this when we rev the dependency version.

# This class maintains a static duration instance of itself which results in one or more glib free functions to get scheduled on "next"
# main loop iteration for the matter default thread context. But since it is process duration, it doesn't get scheduled until
# after main exits (long after the thread context has been cleaned up because we shut down matter), so there is no next loop iteration.
