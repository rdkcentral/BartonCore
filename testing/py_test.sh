# In order for pytests to run successfully with libBartonCore.so compiled
# with AddressSanitizer, libasan.so must be preloaded. This script is a wrapper around
# pytest to handle setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable and passing any extra args
# to pytest. Use this script if you want to execute any pytests on the command line to ensure
# your environment is set up correctly.

# examples:
# ./py_test.sh
# ./py_test.sh -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG


# set -x
set -e
