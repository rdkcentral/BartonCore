    The BaseEnvironmentOrchestrator class is responsible for setting up and managing the
    environment required for testing Barton devices. It initializes the Barton client,
    handles synchronization primitives, and provides various timing methods to ensure
    the environment is ready for testing. Further configuration can be done by derived
    classes.

    Attributes:
        _barton_client (BCore.Client): The client used to interact with the
            Barton device service.
        _barton_client_params (BCore.InitializeParamsContainer): The parameters
            used to initialize and configure Barton client.
        _ready_for_devices_condition (Condition): Condition variable to signal when
            the environment is ready for devices.
        _ready_to_commission (bool): Flag indicating if the environment is ready to
            commission devices.
        _device_added_condition (Condition): Condition variable to signal when a
            device has been added.
        _commissioned_device (bool): Flag indicating if a device has been commissioned.
        _barton_storage_path (str): Path to the storage directory for Barton data.
        _matter_storage_path (str): Path to the storage directory for Matter data.
