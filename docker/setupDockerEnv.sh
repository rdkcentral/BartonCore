# This script is used as a 'pre-step' to set up the Docker environment before any Docker
# build/compose/run invocations occur. The goal of this script is to:
#
# - Set the various environment variables needed for the both the Docker build process,
#   and the runtime environment within a container.
# - Ensure the container network exists before run time.
#
# One result of this script is a .env file containing several variables. These variables
# are needed for two goals:
#
# 1. The compose process:
#    - The compose process will source this file first, which then can be used within the
#      `docker/compose.yaml` file to define some build arguments and a mount volume.
#
# 2. The running container:
#    - The .env file must also be used to define the environment variables within the running
#      container. This file path must be passed as an argument to the `docker run` or `docker compose`
#      commands to setup the runtime environment. This is already defined for you in `dockerw`
#      and `docker/compose.yaml`.
#      After the container has started, see `docker/entrypoint.sh` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
#      to see how these variables are used to define the custom PATHs within the the CLI container
#      and devcontainer respectively.

# The following are environment variables used to set up the environment within the container.
# Some are used to extend standard PATHs within the container, while others are used to define
# the variable globally within the container.
#
# NOTE: If any new PATHs must be added to the container, they should be defined here. Then
#       appended to the existing PATHs within the container after the container has started
#       using `docker/entrypoint.sh` for the CLI container and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
#       for the devcontainer.
#
# The idea behind this custom PATH approach is to:
# 1. Define the custom PATHs we want to append to the running container's standard PATHs before
#    the container is created.
# 2. Pass these custom PATHs into the container at run time using the generated environment
#    variable file `docker/.env`.
# 3. Append the passed in custom PATHs to the existing standard PATHs within the container after
#    the container has started. See `docker/entrypoint.sh` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
#    to see how/when these PATHs are defined in the CLI container and devcontainer respectively.
