# This Dockerfile is used specifically for the devcontainer in VSCode and is leveraged
# in `compose.devcontainer.yaml`. The reasoning behind this file's existence is to get
# around the limitation within VSC that the remote user must be baked into the image
# before run time, unlike the CLI environment.
