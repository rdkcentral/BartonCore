#
# Docker Compose override to switch the container to host networking.
# This is useful when the container needs direct access to devices on the
# host's local network, such as Thread border routers or other Matter-enabled
# devices.
#
# Usage:
#   - CLI (dockerw): Use the -H flag:
#       ./dockerw -H bash
#
#   - Devcontainer: Add this file to the dockerComposeFile array in
#     .devcontainer/devcontainer.json:
#
#       "dockerComposeFile": [
#           "../docker/compose.devcontainer.yaml",
#           "../docker/compose.host-network.yaml"
#       ]
#
# NOTE: Per the Compose Spec, network_mode takes precedence over networks.
#       The barton-ip6net network from the base compose file is ignored when
#       this override is active.
#

services:
    barton:
