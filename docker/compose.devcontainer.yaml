# This compose file is used to create the VSC devcontainer by extending the barton
# service from the base compose.yaml file. It is not meant to be run directly.

# Setting the name element to the user helps keep the container name easy to identify
# by namespacing it with the user's name. Example: $USER-barton-devcontainer-1
name: $BUILDER_USER-barton
