# This compose file is used to create the VSC devcontainer by extending the barton
# service from the base compose.yaml file. It is not meant to be run directly.

# Setting the name element to the user helps keep the container name easy to identify
# by namespacing it with the user's name. Example: $USER-barton-devcontainer-1
name: $BUILDER_USER-barton

services:
    devcontainer:
        extends:
            file: ./compose.yaml
            service: barton

        # devcontainers do not support creating a user at runtime like we do with the
        # `entrypoint.sh` script, so we need to override the base image with
        # Dockerfile.devcontainer file that bakes the user into the image.
