# Setting the name element to the user helps keep the container name easy to identify
# by namespacing it with the user's name. Example: $USER-barton-devcontainer-1
name: $BUILDER_USER-barton

services:
    devcontainer:
        extends:
            file: ../docker/compose.yaml
            service: barton

        build:
            # This compose file's build target will handle the non-root user creation
            # for the devcontainer to login to.
            target: user_builder
